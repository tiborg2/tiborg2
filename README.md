- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiborg2,<br> 
Professional lawyer, diver and coding enthusiast. COVID helped me to opt-out from regular jobs and to find something really exciting – coding.
Started coding in the beginning of 2021 by participation in online boot camp. Learned basics of coding (<C> language) and shell (Linux).
Have certificates in Python (Scientific Computing with Python) and HTML/CSS (Responsive Web Design). Have some  knowledge in SQL.
- Interested in starting to turn coding to professional activity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript basics.<br>
  Main interest in back end or full stack development, but any practical experience at this time would be very helpful.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate. If some team is in need for help in junior level programming activities, I’m ready to participate with great pleasure.
- 📫 You can reach me by email: rytis.cesna@gmail.com.
  Bye. and have a good coding!
